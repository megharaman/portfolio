<p><center>Over the past year, I had participated in TiEs workshop for young entrepreneurs. My group and I had participated in the local competition. We designed a solar powered fan and exhaust system for your car, that automatically turned on when the car reached a certain temperature. We won our local competition, and were able to participate in the Global competition, in which we traveled to Portland, Oregon.</center></p>

<p><center>Indian Classical Singing
I have been learning Indian Classical Music for 9 years. Through traditional Indian music I am able to take part in my heritage and culture.
I have been learning piano since 2008. In 2012, I began working with my singing teacher to combine Western and Traditional Indian Music. I perform recitals multiple times a year.
I have been playing clarinet since 2011. I have developed a strong love for the instrument. I am a part of my school's band and marching band programs. Outside of school, I perform classical and traditional pieces on the clarinet.
I have learned to play the Nadaswaram, an ancient Indian instrument in the past year.</center></p>
